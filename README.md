Ideas:
- Instead of my inital plan of moving everything on the screen up and down, when the cast is made, the hook can be sent to the bottom of the screen which would transition the player to the fishing screen.
- Is adding the ability to go deeper into the water a good idea? It could be too complicated to track the position of the hook and fish.
