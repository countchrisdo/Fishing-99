Ideas:
- The Fishing Contest takes place in the water cooling system of a data center. The fish are all made of corrupted data.

* At spawn depth, activate fish with horizontal swim pattern (sinusoidal or linear)?
* Pool fish sprites using `SpritePool.lua`?
* Lock hook to the center of the screen?
* Add bounds to the hook?
