## Notes

Lua:
- When a file is loaded using require, only globally defined variables in that file become accessible within the calling file's scope. I think?

Ideas:
- The Fishing Contest takes place in the water cooling system of a data center. The fish are all made of corrupted data.

- At spawn, anitmate fish with animator library to simulate natural movement
